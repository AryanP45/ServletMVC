# MVC in JSP


MVC stands for Model View and Controller. It is a design pattern that separates the business logic, presentation logic and data.

**Controller** acts as an interface between View and Model. Controller intercepts all the incoming requests.

**Model** represents the state of the application i.e. data. It can also have business logic.

**View** represents the presentaion i.e. UI(User Interface).
